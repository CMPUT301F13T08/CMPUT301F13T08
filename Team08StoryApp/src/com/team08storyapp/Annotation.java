/**
 * Annotation is a model class representing a reader's Annotations on a
 * Particular Story Fragment. An Annotation has the following properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Annotation Id to uniquely identify the Annotation.
 * <li>Story Fragment Id the Id identified with the Story Fragment the
 * Annotation belongs to.
 * <li>Photo the photo the reader set in the Annotation.
 * <li>Encoded Annotation is the Annotation encoded for storing it in a file or
 * on a webservice.
 * </ul>
 * These properties are able to be accessed through the constructor or through
 * public getters/setters.
 * 
 * A user while reading a Story online or offline has the option to view or add
 * Annotations to each Story Fragment they read. The Annotation is created in
 * the form of a illustration or photo. The user can either add this by taking a
 * picture or uploading it from their phones gallery.
